# NICE_DCL: A Combination of NICE-GAN and DCLGAN

NICE-GAN + DCLGAN = NICEDCL

We believe that we could start with the DCLGAN as a basis and use the feature of the NICEGAN consisting of reusing the encoder.
The model is very similar to the DCLGAN model except that we reuse the discriminatorâ€™s encoder in the generator. Therefore, there is no more encoder in the generator but only in the discriminator. The architecture is then simplified.

## Structure

- Based on the code of DCLGAN ([repo](https://github.com/JunlinHan/DCLGAN/tree/2727288f252cda192b11da1c8c04aff2997eaa6a), [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07689.pdf))
- To see the implementation of the model, nice_dcl_model.py has been added in the models folder.
- In networks.py, the new generator and discriminator have been added. Both generators and discriminators are the one from NICE-GAN ([repo](https://github.com/alpc91/NICE-GAN-pytorch/tree/1b114f1de95be845629a94db667368528a503a7d), [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00273.pdf)).

## What has been done

- Implemented new Generators and Discriminators.
- Settled the decoupled training.
- Created a custom dataset for NIR to RGB translation (NIR2RGB).
- Adapted PatchNCE loss to fit with the new Generators and Discriminators.

## What has to be done

- Correct the Gradient backpropagation issue.
- Train and test the model in the NIR2RGB dataset.
- Compare it with the other models at the state-of-the-art on that same dataset.
